# GLOBAL AID CLUSTER ANALYSIS
## Leveraging Advanced Unsupervised Machine Learning for Data-Driven Clustering to Prioritize Aid for Vulnerable Nations
### INTRODUCTION
This project aims to support **HELP International**, a humanitarian NGO, in identifying and prioritizing countries most in need of aid by analyzing socio-economic and health metrics. Using advanced unsupervised machine learning techniques, the project clusters nations based on critical indicators like GDP per capita, child mortality, and life expectancy. By leveraging data-driven insights, it seeks to optimize resource allocation and address pressing global issues such as poverty, healthcare access, and welfare for vulnerable populations.

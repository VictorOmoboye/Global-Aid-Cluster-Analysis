### INTRODUCTION
This project aims to support **HELP International**, a humanitarian NGO, in identifying and prioritizing countries most in need of aid by analyzing socio-economic and health metrics. Using advanced unsupervised machine learning techniques, the project clusters nations based on critical indicators like GDP per capita, child mortality, and life expectancy. By leveraging data-driven insights, it seeks to optimize resource allocation and address pressing global issues such as poverty, healthcare access, and welfare for vulnerable populations.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
- HELP International seeks to identify countries facing critical socio-economic and health challenges, such as low GDP, high child mortality, and low life expectancy.
- The organization wants to prioritize resource allocation to nations most in need based on data-driven insights.
- A need exists to analyze large datasets containing socio-economic and health metrics to inform the distribution of aid effectively.
- The project must leverage machine learning clustering techniques to group countries by shared vulnerabilities.
- There is a requirement to explore patterns in the data that can guide actionable decisions to improve health, wealth, and opportunities in marginalized nations.

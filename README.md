### INTRODUCTION
This project aims to support **HELP International**, a humanitarian NGO, in identifying and prioritizing countries most in need of aid by analyzing socio-economic and health metrics. Using advanced unsupervised machine learning techniques, the project clusters nations based on critical indicators like GDP per capita, child mortality, and life expectancy. By leveraging data-driven insights, it seeks to optimize resource allocation and address pressing global issues such as poverty, healthcare access, and welfare for vulnerable populations.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
- HELP International seeks to identify countries facing critical socio-economic and health challenges, such as low GDP, high child mortality, and low life expectancy.
- The organization wants to prioritize resource allocation to nations most in need based on data-driven insights.
- A need exists to analyze large datasets containing socio-economic and health metrics to inform the distribution of aid effectively.
- The project must leverage machine learning clustering techniques to group countries by shared vulnerabilities.
- There is a requirement to explore patterns in the data that can guide actionable decisions to improve health, wealth, and opportunities in marginalized nations.

### AIM OF PROJECT
- To leverage advanced unsupervised machine learning techniques to cluster countries based on critical socio-economic and health metrics.
- To identify nations with low GDP, high child mortality, and low life expectancy that are most in need of aid.
- To provide data-driven insights that prioritize resource allocation for vulnerable populations.
- To optimize HELP Internationalâ€™s efforts in addressing global issues such as healthcare access, poverty, and gender equality.
- To ensure efficient and targeted distribution of the $30M donation by focusing on the most at-risk nations.

### METHODOLOGY

- **STEP 1:** Data Cleaning:
    - Handle any missing values.
    - Remove duplicate records or irrelevant columns.
    - Check for and correct anomalies.
      
- **STEP 2:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
    - Visualize distributions and relationships between features.
    - Identify patterns, trends, and potential anomalies.
    - Form hypotheses based on data insights.
      
- **STEP 3:** Data Preprocessing:
    - Scale/normalize numerical features and encode categorical  data.
    - Feature Engineering
      
- **STEP 4:** Model Training:
    - Select and train machine learning models on the data.
    - Elbow Method to find the optimal number of clusters (k).
    - Experiment with different algorithms and assess performance.
      
- **STEP 5:** Model Evaluation (Interpreting Results):
    - Visual Inspection: visualize the clustering results or reduced features to evaluate if meaningful patterns emerge.
